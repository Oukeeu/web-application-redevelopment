# web-application-redevelopment
Reconstruction of a completed web application on pltaforma bitrix.ru for custom requests and changing the logic of the application in the CRM structure 

In this case we created a custom application on the bitrix24 platform. The application was created from the native application from the platform itself, it was necessary to remake its logic, structure and frontend so that it worked the same way, but except for a few factors, as well as to add new logic of the program and modify it.

Work took place in a team of three developers, one of whom was me.

Changes took place in two native platform applications:
1) Calendar.
2) Reports on the employees' working hours

What was done:
1) In the report we added an opportunity to assign a task for each employee for each day (by clicking on a cell a context menu appeared suggesting to choose the task).
2) Added the ability to select the display of sort workers in the created filter.
3) Made a search by employee to select the display.
4) Added a link between assigning tasks to employees and displaying them in the calendar.
5) Modified the calendar and configured the display of set tasks in it.

Stack:
1) PHP.
2) CSS
3) THML
4) JS
5) API/REST
